# Classification-Iris_using-Qutrits
In this repository, I classify the Irish data set https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris using Qutrits and IBM Quantum pulse technology
The idea is having the three classes in the Irish data set, using a quantum neural network (QNN) and a single qubit device, 
train the QNN with this dataset using the three states |0>, |1>, and |2> to classify the three classes Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.
