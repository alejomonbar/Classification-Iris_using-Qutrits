# Classification-Iris_using-Qutrits
In this repository, I classify the Irish data set using Qutrits and IBM Quantum pulse technology
The idea is having the three classes in the Irish data set, using a quantum neural network (QNN) and a single qubit device, 
train the QNN with this dataset and with pulse gates that used the three states |0>, |1>, and |2>
